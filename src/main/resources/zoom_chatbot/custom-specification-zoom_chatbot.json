Then, use the received `access_token` value as a Bearer token when you make the GET `/im/chat/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}` request. \n\n For more information about authorizing Chatbots, read the Chatbot [**Installation and Authentication**](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/chatbots/authorization) documentation.",

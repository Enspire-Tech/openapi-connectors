# Amazon Lookout for Vision Connector
Amazon Lookout for Vision enables you to find visual defects in industrial products, accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to identify missing components in an industrial product, damage to vehicles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects in silicon wafers â€” or any other physical item where quality is important such as a missing capacitor on printed circuit boards.

  - name: AccountBrands
    description: "The AcccountBrands resource provides methods that enable you to create\
    \ and manage brands for an account.\n\nBranding enables you to add the look and\
    \ feel of your organization's brand to the sending, signing, and email processes,\
    \ making it easier for recipients to identify envelopes coming from your organization.\n\
    \nThe DocuSign Account Custom Branding feature enables you to set the colors,\
    \ logo, and text that recipients see at the account level. The settings associated\
    \ with a brand are applied to all of the envelopes that use the brand. You can\
    \ create multiple brand profiles for different corporate brands or internal departments.\n\
    \n**Note**: To use this resource, branding for either signing or sending must\
    \ be enabled for the account (either `canSelfBrandSend`, `canSelfBrandSign`, or\
    \ both of these account settings must be set to **true**). "
  - name: AccountConsumerDisclosures
    description: "The `AccountConsumerDisclosures` resource provides methods that enable\
    \ you to enable, retrieve, and manage the Electronic Record and Signature Consent\
    \ Disclosure (ERSD) options for your account. This is the disclosure that displays\
    \ to each new recipient who is going to sign or add other information, or who\
    \ is required to view the documents you send to them. The recipient must read\
    \ and agree to the terms of the disclosure before they can access and take action\
    \ on the documents you send. The ERSD does not apply to copy-only recipients,\
    \ but does apply to recipients who must sign or view your documents.\n\nYou can\
    \ use either the default ERSD that DocuSign provides for U.S.-based transactions,\
    \ or a custom ERSD. \n\n## Languages\n\n**Important**: The system does not translate\
    \ the ERSD for you. The default ERSD is always in English. For a custom ERSD,\
    \ an account administrator must create a version of the disclosure for each language\
    \ that your signers use. When you create a version of your custom ERSD for a specific\
    \ signer language, you must:\n\n1. Specify the language code (`langCode`) for\
    \ the signer language.\n2. Provide the `esignAgreementText` and `esignText` in\
    \ the language associated with the `langCode`.\n\nFor more information, see [Legal\
    \ Disclosure](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-admin-guide-legal-disclosure)."
  - name: AccountCustomFields
    description: "Custom fields enable you to record custom information about envelopes\
    \ that you can then use for sorting, organizing, searching, and other downstream\
    \ processes. \n\nFor example, you can use custom fields to copy envelopes or data\
    \ to multiple areas in Salesforce. eOriginal customers can eVault all of their\
    \ documents from the web app by setting an account custom field with a name like\
    \ `eVault with eOriginal` to **true**.\n\nYou can also use account custom fields\
    \ to set the following information:\n\n- Tracking ID\n- Department \n- Use case\n\
    - Other envelope metadata\n\n## Envelope Custom Field Visibility\n\nWhen you create\
    \ an envelope custom field for your account, you have the following options: \n\
    \n- Make it a required field for senders at the time of sending\n- Display it\
    \ as an optional field at the time of sending\n- Set a specific value for the\
    \ field behind the scenes (NOT SURE IF THIS IS RIGHT; MIGHT JUST BE AN UNUSED\
    \ DRAFT FIELD)\n\nEnvelope recipients do not see the envelope custom fields.\n\
    \n## Types of Envelope Custom Fields\n\nThere are two types of envelope custom\
    \ fields:\n\n- `text`: Enables the sender to enter the value for the field. \n\
    - `list`: Enables the sender to select the value of the field from a predetermined\
    \ list."
  - name: EnvelopeCustomFields
    description: "The EnvelopeCustomFields resource provides methods that allow you\
    \ manage custom fields in an envelope. \n\nCustom fields can be used in the envelopes\
    \ for your account to record information about the envelope, help search for envelopes\
    \ and track information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope\
    \ Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member\
    \ console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.\n\
    \nThere are two types of envelope custom fields:\n\n- `text`: Enables the sender\
    \ to enter the value for the field. \n- `list`: Enables the sender to select the\
    \ value of the field from a predetermined list.\n\nYou may assign up to three\
    \ envelope custom fields to an envelope. This limit does not include account (document)\
    \ custom fields."
  - name: EnvelopeDocumentFields
    description: "The EnvelopeDocumentFields resource provides methods that allow you\
    \ to manage custom fields on a document.\n\nYou can create custom versions of\
    \ standard fields that combine of field properties, such as font type or size,\
    \ or a validation setting. \n\nNote: Some advanced features and options are supported\
    \ only in certain DocuSign plans. Your account plan might not support some options\
    \ discussed in this help topic. For more information about which options are available\
    \ for your account, check your account plan or contact your Account Manager."
  - name: EnvelopeLocks
    description: |-
      The EnvelopeLocks resource provides methods that allow you to
      manage locks on an envelope.

      To prevent users from changing an envelope while another user is
      modifying it, you can lock the envelope and set the time until
      the lock expires.

      For example, you would use the following flow:

      1. Lock the envelope.
      2. Make changes to envelope.
      3. Delete the envelope lock and save the changes. If the envelope is based on a template that has a password, you must supply the template password to save the changes.

      **Note**: To use envelope locks, the user must have envelope locking capability enabled.
  - name: EnvelopeRecipients
    description: "The EnvelopeRecipients resource enables you manage the recipients\
    \ of an envelope. All recipient types share a set of [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters),\
    \ but some recipient types have additional parameters. You specify the recipient\
    \ type using the `recipientType` parameter. The recipient types are as follows:\n\
    \n<br>\n\n| Recipient type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| [Agent](#agent-recipient)\
    \ | Agent recipients can add name and email information for recipients that appear\
    \ after the agent in routing order. |\n| [Carbon Copy](#carbon-copy-recipient)\
    \ | Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope but don't need to sign,\
    \ initial, date, or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient\
    \ can be used in any routing order. Carbon copy recipients receive their copy\
    \ of the envelope when the envelope reaches the recipient's order in the process\
    \ flow and when the envelope is completed. |\n| [Certified Delivery](#certified-delivery-recipient)\
    \ | Certified delivery recipients must receive the completed documents for the\
    \ envelope to be completed. However, they don't need to sign, initial, date, or\
    \ add information to any of the documents. |\n| [Editor](#editor-recipient) |\
    \ Editors have the same management and access rights for the envelope as the sender.\
    \ They can make changes to the envelope as if they were using the Advanced Correct\
    \ feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the\
    \ routing order, set authentication options, and can edit signature/initial tabs\
    \ and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign\
    \ account to be an editor. |\n| [In-Person Signer](#in-person-signer-recipient)\
    \ | In-person signer recipients are DocuSign users who act as signing hosts in\
    \ the same physical location as the signer. |\n| [Intermediary](#intermediary-recipient)\
    \ | Intermediaries are recipients who can, but are not required to, add name and\
    \ email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing\
    \ order, unless subsequent agents, editors, or intermediaries are added. |\n|\
    \ [Seal](#seal-recipient) | Electronic seal recipients represent legal entities\
    \ rather than individuals. Organizations and governments can use electronic seals\
    \ to show evidence of origin and integrity of documents. |\n| [Signer](#signer-recipient)\
    \ | Signers are recipients who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form fields\
    \ on the documents in the envelope. |\n| [Witness](#witness-recipient) | Witnesses\
    \ are recipients whose signatures affirm that the identified signers have signed\
    \ the documents in the envelope. |\n\n<br>\n\nNot all recipients are are available\
    \ to all account types. Review your account plan to determine which recipient\
    \ types are available to you. All recipient types are available in the Demo environment.\n\
    \n\n## Core Recipient Parameters\n\nAll recipients, regardless of type, have the\
    \ same common core parameters. The following table contains the descriptions for\
    \ the core properties for all recipient types:\n\n<br>\n\n| Name | Required |\
    \ Schema Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| email | Yes |\
    \ Email | Email of the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum\
    \ Length: 100 characters. |\n| name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum\
    \ Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>**Note:** If you are creating an envelope with\
    \ DocuSign EU advanced signature enabled, ensure that recipient names do not contain\
    \ any of the following characters: **^ : \\ @ , + <** |\n| accessCode | No | String\
    \ | This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to\
    \ validate the identity.<br/>Maximum Length: 50 characters. |\n| addAccessCodeToEmail\
    \ | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates that the access code is added\
    \ to the email sent to the recipient; this nullifies the Security measure of Access\
    \ Code on the recipient. |\n| agentCanEditEmail | No | Boolean | When set to **true**,\
    \ the agent recipient associated with this recipient can change the recipient's\
    \ pre-populated email address. This element is only active if enabled for the\
    \ account. |\n| agentCanEditName | No | Boolean | When set to **true**, the agent\
    \ recipient associated with this recipient can change the recipient's pre-populated\
    \ name (`UserName`). This element is only active if enabled for the account. |\n\
    | clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded\
    \ or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient\
    \ is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount`\
    \ or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true**,\
    \ an error is generated on sending. Maximum length: 100 characters. |\n| embeddedRecipientStartURL\
    \ | No | String | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an\
    \ embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives\
    \ an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document\
    \ link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign,\
    \ to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to\
    \ the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient\
    \ token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`\
    \ is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing\
    \ process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by\
    \ the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion\
    \ records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an\
    \ embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It\
    \ is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication\
    \ of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and\
    \ DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing\
    \ the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending\
    \ application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However,\
    \ when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property\
    \ to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or\
    \ viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps\
    \ the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one\
    \ of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication,\
    \ SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If\
    \ the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property\
    \ is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process\
    \ for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL`\
    \ property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId,\
    \ recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields\
    \ must be part of the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in\
    \ double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/\
    \ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |\n| customFields | No\
    \ | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide\
    \ custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the envelope\
    \ status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have\
    \ a maximum length of 100 characters. |\n| emailNotification | No | emailNotification\
    \ | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for\
    \ the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*:\
    \ a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000\
    \ characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email\
    \ sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*:\
    \ The simple type enumeration (two-letter code) for the language to use for the\
    \ standard email format and the signing view for the recipient. To retrieve the\
    \ possible values, use the [Accounts::listSupportedLanguages method][ListLang].<br/><br/>**Note**:\
    \ You can set the `emailNotification` property separately for each recipient.\
    \ If you set the value only for certain recipients, the other recipients will\
    \ inherit the this value from the top-level `emailSubject` and `emailBlurb`. \
    \ |\n| excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that\
    \ are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the\
    \ account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the\
    \ envelope to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is\
    \ set to **true**, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have\
    \ a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent,\
    \ Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon\
    \ Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically\
    \ excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not\
    \ have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically\
    \ excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. |\n| idCheckConfigurationName\
    \ | No | String |Specifies authentication check by name. The names used here must\
    \ be the same as the authentication type names used by the account (these name\
    \ can also be found in the web console sending interface in the Identify list\
    \ for a recipient). This overrides any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>\
    \ Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console\
    \ Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID check\
    \ in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set to `ID\
    \ Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must add phone\
    \ number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|\n| iDCheckInformationInput\
    \ | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex element contains input information\
    \ related to a recipient ID check. It can include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*:\
    \ Used to set recipient address information and consists of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*:\
    \ consists of six elements, with street2 and zipPlus4 being optional. The elements\
    \ are: street1, street2, city, state, zip, zipPlus4\\. The maximum number of characters\
    \ in each element are: street1/street2 = 150 characters, city = 50 characters,\
    \ state = 2 characters, and zip/zipPlus4 = 20 characters.<br/><br/>displayLevelCode:\
    \ Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable,\
    \ or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies\
    \ if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*dobInformationInput*:\
    \ Used to set recipient date of birth information and consists of:<br/><br/>*dateOfBirth*:\
    \ Specifies the recipient's date, month and year of birth.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*:\
    \ Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable,\
    \ or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies\
    \ if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn4InformationInput*:\
    \ Used to set the last four digits of the recipient's SSN information and consists\
    \ of:<br/><br/>*ssn4*: Specifies the last four digits of the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*:\
    \ Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable,\
    \ or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies\
    \ if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn9InformationInput*:\
    \ Used to set the recipient's SSN information. Note that the ssn9 information\
    \ can never be returned in the response. The ssn9 input consists of:<br/><br/><br/><br/>*ssn9*:\
    \ Specifies the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display\
    \ level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay. |\n\
    | inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration | No | Boolean | Optional element. If\
    \ true and the envelope recipient creates a DocuSign account after signing, the\
    \ Manage Account Email Notification settings are used as the default settings\
    \ for the recipient's account. |\n| note | No | String | A note that is unique\
    \ to this recipient. This note is sent to the recipient via the signing email.\
    \ The note displays in the signing UI near the upper left corner of the document\
    \ on the signing screen.<br/>Maximum Length: 1000 characters. |\n| phoneAuthentication\
    \ | No | RecipientPhoneAuthentication | Optional element. Contains the elements:\
    \ <br/><br/> *recipMayProvideNumber*:Boolean. When set to **true** thenrecipient\
    \ can use whatever phone number they choose to.<br/><br/> *senderProvidedNumbers*:\
    \ ArrayOfString. A list of phone numbers the recipient can use. <br/>\n| recipientId\
    \ | No | String | Unique for the recipient. It is used by the tab element to indicate\
    \ which recipient is to sign the Document. |\n| requireIdLookup | No | Boolean\
    \ | When set to **true**, the recipient is required to use the specified ID check\
    \ method (including Phone and SMS authentication) to validate their identity.\
    \ |\n| roleName | No* | String | Optional element. Specifies the role name associated\
    \ with the recipient.<br/><br/>This is required when working with template recipients.\
    \ |\n| routingOrder | Yes | String | This element specifies the routing order\
    \ of the recipient in the envelope. |\n| smsAuthentication | No | senderProvidedNumbers\
    \ | Optional element. Contains the element:<br/><br/>*senderProvidedNumbers*:\
    \ Array that contains a list of phone numbers the recipient can use for SMS text\
    \ authentication. |\n| templateAccessCodeRequired | No | Boolean | Optional element.\
    \ Used only when working with template recipients. When set to **true** and the\
    \ `TemplateLocked` parameter is set to **true**, the sender must enter an access\
    \ code. |\n| templateLocked | No | Boolean | Optional element. Used only when\
    \ working with template recipients. When set to **true**, the sender cannot change\
    \ any attributes of the recipient. |\n| templateRequired | No | Boolean | Optional\
    \ element. Used only when working with template recipients. When set to **true**,\
    \  the sender may not remove the recipient. |\n| identityVerification <a name=\"\
    toto\"></a> | No | identityVerification | Optional element. Specifies ID Verification\
    \ applied on an envelope by workflow ID. <br/>See the [list](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/accounts/identityverifications/list/)\
    \ method in the [IdentityVerifications](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/accounts/identityverifications/)\
    \ resource for more information on how to retrieve workflow IDs available for\
    \ an account. <br/>This can be used in addition to other [recipient authentication](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/recipients/auth/)\
    \ methods. <br/>Note that ID Verification and ID Check are two distinct methods.\
    \ ID Verification checks recipients' identity by verifying their ID while ID Check\
    \ relies on data available on public records (such as current and former address).\
    \ |\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n## Agent Recipient\n\nAn agent recipient can add name and email\
    \ information for recipients that appear after the agent in routing order.\n\n\
    In addition to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters), this recipient\

    ## Intermediary Recipient\n\nAn intermediary is a recipient who can, but is not\
    \ required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent\
    \ level in the routing order, unless subsequent agents, editors or intermediaries\
    \ are added.\n\nIn addition to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters),\
    \ this recipient type has the following parameters:\n\n<br>\n\n\n| Name | Required\
    \ | Schema Type | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| documentVisibility\
    \ | No | documentVisibility | A complex type that specifies which documents are\
    \ visible to this recipient. |\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n## Seal Recipient\n\nAn electronic\
    \ seal recipient is a legal entity rather than an actual person. Electronic Seals\
    \ can be used by organizations and governments to show evidence of origin and\
    \ integrity of documents. Even though electronic seals can be represented by a\
    \ tab in a document, they do not require user interaction and apply automatically\
    \ in the order specified by the sender. The sender is therefore the person authorizing\
    \ usage of the electronic seal in the flow.\n\nElectronic seal recipients rely\
    \ on a subset of core properties, described as follows, plus the `recipientSignatureProviders`\
    \ parameter:\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n| Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\
    \ | Required&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\
    \ | Schema Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\
    \ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| recipientId| Yes | String | Indicates the\
    \ unique ID of the applied electronic seal.<br/>|\n| routingOrder| No (default:\
    \ 1) | String | Specifies the routing order of the electronic seal in the envelope.\
    \ <br />The routing order assigned to your electronic seal cannot be shared with\
    \ another recipient. It is recommended that you set a routing order for your electronic\
    \ seals.. |\n| recipientSignatureProviders| Yes | String | Indicates which electronic\
    \ seal to apply on documents when creating an envelope. |\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n\nBy\
    \ default, Electronic Seals apply on all documents in an envelope. However, the\
    \ sealDocumentsWithTabsOnly property (see recipientSignatureProvider) allows you\
    \ to seal only documents that have signHere tabs set for the Electronic Seal recipients.\n\
    \n<br>\n\n\n\n## Signer Recipient\n\nA signer is a recipient who must sign, initial,\
    \ date, or add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope.\n\nIn addition\
    \ to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters), this recipient type adds\
    \ the following parameters:\n\n<br>\n\n\n| Name | Required | Schema Type | Description\
    \ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| autoNavigation | No | Boolean | Specifies\
    \ whether auto navigation is set for the recipient.|\n| defaultRecipient | No\
    \ | Boolean | When set to **true**, this is the default recipient for the envelope.\
    \ This option is used with the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms method. |\n\
    | documentVisibility | No | documentVisibility | A complex type that specifies\
    \ which documents are visible to this recipient. |\n| isBulkRecipient | No | Boolean\
    \ | Indicates whether the recipient is a bulk send recipient or not. |\n| recipientSuppliesTabs\
    \ | No | Boolean | Indicates whether the recipient supplies tabs in the document.\
    \ |\n| signInEachLocation | No | Boolean | When set to **true** and the feature\
    \ is enabled in the sender's account, the signing recipient is required to draw\
    \ signatures and initials at each signature/initial tab (instead of adopting a\
    \ signature/initial style or only drawing a signature/initial once). |\n| signatureInfo\
    \ | No | String | Optional element only used with recipient types In Person Signers,\
    \ Signers, and Witnesses.<br/><br/>Allows the sender to pre-specify the signature\
    \ name, signature initials, and signature font used in the signature stamp for\
    \ the recipient. |\n| signerEmail | No | String | Optional element. The email\
    \ address for an In-Person Signer recipient Type.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.\
    \ |\n| signerName | Yes | String | Required element with recipient type In Person\
    \ Signers.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>The full legal name of\
    \ a signer for the envelope. |\n| tabs | No | Tab | Optional element only used\
    \ with recipient types In Person Signers and Signers.<br/><br/>Specifies the Tabs\
    \ associated with the recipient. See the the [EnvelopeRecipientTabs resource](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/enveloperecipienttabs/)\
    \  for more information about tabs. |\n\n<br>\n\n[enotary-resources]: https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-enotary-resources\n\
    \n\n## Witness Recipient\n\nA witness is a recipient whose signature affirms that\
    \ the identified signers have signed the documents in the envelope.\n\nIn addition\
    \ to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters), this recipient type adds\
    \ the following parameters:\n\n<br>\n\n\n| Name | Required | Schema Type | Description\
    \ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| autoNavigation | No | Boolean |\tSpecifies\
    \ whether auto navigation is set for the recipient. |\n| defaultRecipient | No\
    \ | Boolean | When set to **true**, this is the default recipient for the envelope.\
    \ This option is used when creating an envelope from a template. |\n| documentVisibility\
    \ | No | documentVisibility | A complex type that specifies which documents are\
    \ visible to this recipient. |\n| isBulkRecipient | No | Boolean | Indicates whether\
    \ the recipient is a bulk send recipient or not. |\n| recipientSignatureProviders\
    \ | Yes | String | Indicates which electronic seal to apply on documents when\
    \ creating an envelope. |\n| recipientSuppliesTabs | No | Boolean | Indicates\
    \ whether the recipient supplies tabs in the document. |\n| recipientType | Yes\
    \ | String | Indicates the recipient type. |\n|requireSignerCertificate | No |\
    \ Boolean | Indicates whether the envelope requires a signer certificate for this\
    \ recipient. |\n| requireSignOnPaper | No | Boolean | Specifies whether the signer\
    \ must print, sign, and upload or fax the signed documents to DocuSign. |\n| signatureInfo\
    \ | No | Boolean | Optional element only used with recipient types In Person Signers,\
    \ Signers, and Witnesses. Enables the sender to pre-specify the signature name,\
    \ signature initials, and signature font used in the signature stamp for the recipient.\
    \ |\n| signInEachLocation | No | Boolean | When set to **true** and the feature\
    \ is enabled in the sender's account, specifies that the signing recipient is\
    \ required to sign and initial at each signature/initial tab (instead of once).\
    \ |\n| signingGroupId | No | String | The id of the [signing group](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-signing-groups).\
    \ |\n| signingGroupName | No | String | The display name for the signing group.\
    \ Maximum Length: 100 characters. |\n| signingGroupUsers | No | userInfo | A complex\
    \ type that contains information about the users in the signing group. |\n| witnessFor\
    \ | Yes | String | Indicates the person or party for whom the recipient is a witness.\
    \ |\n| witnessForGuid | Yes | String | GUID identifying the person or party for\
    \ whom the recipient is a witness. |\n\n\n[ListLang]: https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/Accounts/Accounts/listSupportedLanguages/\n"

    Those tabs' values can be preset either through the web browser\nor via the API.\
    \ Other tab types use information that is already\nrecognized by the DocuSign\
    \ platform.\nThese tabs cannot have their value updated on a per-tab basis\nby\
    \ the API or via the browser. In some cases, the info might be\nsettable using\
    \ a different technique.\nFor example, the Full name tab uses the signer's name,\n\
    which is set elsewhere in the request.\n\nHere is the list of tabs and whether\

    \ eSignature REST API\nlets you collect payments\nalong with signatures and other\
    \ information.\n\nTo send a request for payment\nand collect payments,\nyou need\
    \ a payment gateway account,\nwhich is the destination for the payments.\nCreate\
    \ a payment account\nwith a supported payment gateway,\nand then connect the payment\
    \ gateway account\nto your DocuSign account.\nTo learn how to connect a payment\
    \ gateway account\nto your DocuSign account\nsee [Managing Payment Gateways][paymentgateways]\n\
    in the DocuSign Support Center.\nYou must connect and manage payment gateway accounts\
    \ manually\nthrough the DocuSign Admin console\nand through your chosen payment\
    \ gateway.\nThere is no public API\nfor connecting payment gateway accounts\n\
    to DocuSign accounts\nor for managing payment gateway accounts.\n\nCurrently\n\
    [Stripe][stripe],\n[Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), and\n[Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/)\n\
    are the supported payment gateways.\n\n### How Payments Work\n\nTo make a request\
    \ for payment,\nuse a [`formulaTab`][formulatab]\nthat has a\n[`paymentDetails`][paymentdetails]\
    \ object.\nThis object includes\na list of [`paymentLineItem`][paymentlineitem]\
    \ objects.\nEach line item refers to a [`number`][numbertab] tab\nthat contains\
    \ the value of the each item.\nThe purpose of the line items\nis to transmit them\
    \ to the payment gateway\nas metadata, so that you can use the information\nin\
    \ the payment processor.\n\n**Note**: If the fileExtension parameter is not added\
    \ in an API call, only base64 converted pdf files will be accepted.\nAny attempt\
    \ to send a non pdf file without using fileExtension results in an error.\n\n\
    This is an example request for two books.\nEach book is specified in the `number`\
    \ tabs\nlabeled \"Hamlet\" and \"Tempest\".\nThe books are referenced as line\
    \ items\nby their tab labels\nwithin the `paymentDetails` object\nof a `formula`\
    \ tab.\nThe formula of the `formula` tab\nadd the values of the same two `number`\
    \ tabs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"documents\": [\n    {\n      \"documentBase64\": \"\

    \n#### How to make a request for future payments\n\nUse the following steps to\
    \ make a request to collect a signer's payment method for future use:\n\n1. Add\
    \ a text tab with a descriptive `tabLabel` such as `FuturePayment`.\n2. In the\
    \ formula tab's `paymentDetails` object, add a `lineItem` object that references\
    \ the `tabLabel` from step 1.\n\n**Note**: Do not include this new `lineItem`\
    \ in formula calculations.\n\nThe following example builds on the previous code\
    \ block to also collect a payment method for future use:\n\n```\n{\n  \"documents\"\
    : [\n    {\n      \"documentBase64\": \"<base64-encoded PDF document>\",\n   \
    \   \"documentId\": \"1\",\n      \"fileExtension\": \"pdf\",\n      \"name\"\

    \ Keep in Mind About Payments\n\n* An envelope is not completed until all payments\
    \ are completed.\n\n* If a DocuSign account Administrator\n  deletes a payment\
    \ gateway account connection\n  DocuSign cancels all in-process envelopes\n  that\
    \ reference the deleted payment gateway account.\n\n* If the sender voids an envelope,\n\
    \  all payment authorizations are canceled.\n\n* If a required recipient refuses\
    \ to sign,\n  all authorized payments are canceled.\n\n* If a required recipient's\
    \ payment fails authorization,\n  DocuSign attempts to recover\n  by sending the\
    \ recipient\n  notification about the failed payment authorization.\n  The recipient\
    \ has the opportunity\n  to correct the payment method information.\n\n* Each\
    \ recipient's payment is authorized separately.\n  Accounts are charged and payment\
    \ made\n  after all required tabs are completed,\n  and all payments in an envelope\
    \ for all recipients are authorized.\n\n* Refunds are not supported.\n  Conduct\
    \ refunds or payment changes\n  with the payment gateway separately from DocuSign.\n\
    \n* At this time, DocuSign does not charge a per-transaction fee.\n\n\n[enveloperecipientslist]:\

    \ and Templates\n\nCustom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates\nby setting\
    \ the `customTabId` property\nwhen creating an envelope or template recipient\n\
    or when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.\nThe custom tab must be added\
    \ as the correct tab type.\nFor example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot\
    \ be used as a number tab.\n\nWhen the `customTabId` property is set,\nthe new\
    \ tab inherits all the custom tab properties.\nRequired information that is not\
    \ included in the custom tab,\nsuch as document ID and page ID, must be included\
    \ when adding the tab.\nIf the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X\
    \ and Y positions must be included.\n\nAfter the tab is created,\nit is treated\
    \ as any other tab for updating or deleting.\n\n## Anchoring Tabs\n\nThe tab anchoring\
    \ option\nallows you to send documents for signature\nthat do not have a fixed\
    \ layout or format.\nIn these documents you might not know\nthe absolute location\
    \ of the tabs\nwhen you design your API client application because the tabs must\
    \ move with text.\nAs an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,\n\
    the DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab\nby correlating\
    \ anchor information to data within the document.\n\nWhen the DocuSign Service\
    \ receives a request that contains tabs\nwith anchor information,\nit searches\
    \ the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.\nWhen found,\nit\
    \ places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.\nTab positions\
    \ are established by setting offsets for the tab.\n\nWhen you apply tabs to the\
    \ document,\nDocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString`\
    \ property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the\
    \ background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes\
    \ and it will not be visible on the document.\n\nTo use an anchoring option:\n\
    \n1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing\
    \ text string or add a new one.\nFor best performance DocuSign recommends using\
    \ single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large\
    \ number of pages in the envelope.\nFor example, you might want to add a Sign\
    \ Here tab to the \"Borrower's Signature\" lines in a document, but that phrase\
    \ might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear.\
    \ In this case, you could add the text \"BorrowerSignHere\" in white font color\
    \ (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here\
    \ tabs to appear and use \"BorrowerSignHere\" as the anchor string.\n1. Reference\
    \ the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.\n1. Determine the\
    \ offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed.\n\n\
    Setting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on\
    \ the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down\
    \ the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.\n\
    For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent\
    \ to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative\
    \ to that.\nFor all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent\
    \ to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to\
    \ that.\nDocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values.\
    \ Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.\n\
    \n### Rules for working with anchor tags\n\nWhen anchor tabs are used, all documents\
    \ in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.\n\n* You set the\
    \ text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are\
    \ created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document,\
    \ so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not\
    \ result in unintentional tabs.\n* You cannot use the same anchored tab for different\
    \ recipients for the same document.\n* The DocuSign system cannot search for text\
    \ that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.\n* X or Y offsets\
    \ supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use\
    \ different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient,\
    \ create multiple, unique anchor tabs.\n* If the Y offset value of an anchor string\
    \ would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page\
    \ boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries,\
    \ the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes\
    \ the X offset that resulted in the error.\n* The system does not support an anchor\
    \ string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.\n* The system\
    \ does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility\
    \ of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential\
    \ width of the ultimate tab value.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\nThe following are\
    \ tips for effective use of anchor tags:\n* In order to avoid unintentional conflicts\
    \ between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally\
    \ exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text\
    \ that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.\n* Develop an extensible\
    \ and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.\n* Especially\
    \ for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source\
    \ document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations.\
    \ Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor\
    \ tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all\
    \ use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.\n\n##\
    \ Automatically Populating Tabs\n\nIf you want similar tab types\nto automatically\
    \ populate with the same data,\nyou must follow these guidelines:\n\n* Each `tabLabel`\
    \ entry must have the characters\n  `\\\\*` in front of the label.\n  If you omit\
    \ the `\\\\*` prefix,\n  only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.\n\n\
    \  When automatically populating tabs,\n  the `tabLabel` must not contain any\
    \ spaces.\n  In the JSON example below,\n  the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName`\
    \ and `StudentFirstName`\n  will be auto-populated as specified (\"Doe\" and \"\
    John\")\n  each place they appear throughout the envelope.\n\n  ```\n  \"tabs\"\
    : {\n    \"textTabs\": [\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentLastName\"\
    ,\n      \"value\": \"Doe\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentFirstName\"\
    ,\n      \"value\": \"John\"\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n* Note that `\\\\*` matches\
    \ _anything_.  If you were to add\n  another tab with the `tabLabel` set to `\\\
    \\*Name` to the\n  example above, it would end up matching the other two\n  labels\
    \ as well.\n\n* Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.\n\n\
    \  For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,\n  each with `tabLabel`\
    \ set to `Name`.\n  If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true**,\n  and\
    \ the other has the `bold` property set to **false**,\n  only the first one will\
    \ be populated.\n  In order to automatically populate both occurrences\n  of the\
    \ `Name` Text tabs,\n  the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both\
    \ tabs.\n"

      Standards-Based Signatures (SBS) is the label used to describe DocuSign's suite of signatures that comply with regional and industry regulations, such as the electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) regulation in Europe.

      ## Feature Differences When Using Standards-Based Signatures

      Some DocuSign features are not compatible with Standards-Based Signatures, while others work somewhat differently. It's important to understand these key differences.

      ### DocuSign Features Not Compatible with SBS

      - Attachment by fax
      - Concatenation of signer attachments
      - Legacy digital signatures
      - Markup
      - Notary

      ### DocuSign Features That Change with SBS

      The following features work slightly differently with SBS:

      - **Advanced Correct**: After the first signature, adding or deleting a field is not allowed. This behavior occurs because SBS does not allow adding or removing form fields after a digital signature has already been applied to a PDF.
      - **Downloading Combined Envelopes**: A combined PDF is not digitally signed. This behavior occurs because concatenating digitally signed PDFs breaks the digital signatures on the PDFs.
      - **Freeform Signing**: After someone has signed, allows only signature and initials on free-form. This behavior occurs because if another signer has already signed the document, adding fields other than signature fields will break the existing digital signatures on the document.
      - **Watermarks**: All watermarks are added as PDF annotations. This behavior occurs because burning the watermark into the PDF will break the digital signatures on the document.
      - **Wet Signing**: Wet-signed documents are added as new documents to envelopes. This behavior results in the uploaded or faxed, physically signed document being added as a new document to the envelope. This new document gets only a platform seal.

  - name: ConnectConfigurations

    \ your account. You can set account-level webhooks to listen for events for envelopes\
    \ sent by a specific user on your account, by multiple specific users, or from\
    \ any of the users on your account. These events will be tracked, and can be delivered\
    \ to a listening application.\n\n**Note**: To use DocuSign Connect, it must be\
    \ enabled in your DocuSign account. It is not enabled by default.\n\n## Aggregated\
    \ Messages\n\nTo avoid duplicate simultaneous events, you can configure Connect\
    \ to aggregate similar events into a single delivery. By default, aggregation\
    \ is enabled on all Connect configurations. Similar or simultaneous events will\
    \ be aggregated so your listener doesn't receive extraneous messages. \n\nFor\
    \ example, when the final recipient signs an envelope,  the system delivers a\
    \ single, aggregated Connect event, rather than separate Recipient: complete and\
    \ Envelope: complete messages. This aggregation process ensures that you only\
    \ receive the minimal viable number of messages about an envelope's life cycle.\
    \ \n\n## Send Individual Messages\n\nWhen you enable Send Individual Messages\
    \ (SIM) mode on a Connect configuration, DocuSign will deliver notifications for\
    \ all envelope events individually. In contrast with aggregated messages, when\
    \ a final recipient completes an envelope, your listener will receive a single\
    \ Recipient: complete event followed by a single Envelope: complete event for\
    \ the final participating party on the agreement.  If you need more granular control\
    \ over event notifications, you can enable SIM mode in the Admin area of the RADmin\

    description: "The Envelope resource provides methods that allow you to manipulate\
    \ and monitor envelopes. \n\nOnce you have authenticated the user you can use\
    \ the Envelopes: createEnvelope method to create an envelope. You can call the\
    \ EnvelopeDocuments: update or EnvelopeDocuments: updateList method to add additional\
    \ documents.\n\nSetting the `status` property on the envelope to `sent` allows\
    \ you to send it or `created` to save it as a draft.\n\nYou can receive envelope\

  - name: GroupBrands
    description: For the custom groups you define for your account, you can assign brands
      to specify the ones that group members can use. Group members can use the available
      brands when they send envelopes or create templates. For more information, see

      The Groups resource provides methods that allow you to manage groups for the account.

      Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group. A group can be associated with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions for users in that group without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user. You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but this makes it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. Groups can also be used with template sharing to limit user access to templates.

    description: |
      The TemplateRecipients resource allows you manage the recipients of an template.

      The exact parameters associated with a recipient depend on the recipient type. There are seven recipient types: Agents, Carbon Copies, Certified Deliveries, Editors, In Person Signers, Intermediaries, and Signers.

      Not all recipients are are available to all account types, review you account plan to determine which recipient types are available to you. If you are working in the Demo environment, all recipient types are available.

      Each recipient type is described below:

      [Agents](#agents): This recipient can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the recipient in routing order.

      [Carbon Copies](#carboncopies): Use this action if the recipient should get a copy of the template, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be placed in any order in the recipient list. The recipient receives a copy of the template when the template reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the template is completed.

      [Certified Deliveries](#certifiedDeliveries): Use this action if the recipient must receive the completed documents for the template to be completed, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents.

      [Editors](#editors): This recipient has the same management and access rights for the template as the sender and can make changes to the template as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor.

      [In Person Signers](#inPerson): Use this action if the signer is in the same physical location as a DocuSign user who will act as a Signing Host for the transaction. The recipient added is the Signing Host and new separate Signer Name field appears after Sign in person is selected.

      [Intermediaries](#intermediaries): This recipient can, but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order (until subsequent Agents, Editors or Intermediaries recipient types are added).

      [Signers](#signers): Use this action if your recipient must sign, initial, date or add data to form fields on the documents in the template.

      ### Core Recipient Parameters

      The following table contains the descriptions for the core properties for a recipient.

      | Name | Required? | Schema Type | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | email | Yes | Email | Email of the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | accessCode | No | String | This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity.<br/>Maximum Length: 50 characters. |
      | addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient; this nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |
      | clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true**, an error is generated on sending. |
      | embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: templateId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or template. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |
      | customFields | No | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the template status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a maximum length of 100 characters. |
      | emailNotification | No | emailNotification | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*: a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000 characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*: The simple type enumeration of the language used. The supported languages, with the language value shown in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia (id), Bahasa Melayu (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN), Chinese Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English US (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), French Canada (fr_CA), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hindi (hi), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian (no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR), Romanian (ro),Russian (ru), Serbian (sr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX), Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian (uk) and Vietnamese (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT**: If this is enabled for one recipient, it overrides the Template Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings. Also, you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |
      | excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the template to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is set to **true**, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an template, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. |
      | idCheckConfigurationName | No | String |Specifies authentication check by name. The names used here must be the same as the authentication type names used by the account (these name can also be found in the web console sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient). This overrides any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/> Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID check in an template, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set to `ID Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|
      | iDCheckInformationInput | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex element contains input information related to a recipient ID check. It can include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*: Used to set recipient address information and consists of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*: consists of six elements, with street2 and zipPlus4 being optional. The elements are: street1, street2, city, state, zip, zipPlus4\. The maximum number of characters in each element are: street1/street2 = 150 characters, city = 50 characters, state = 2 characters, and zip/zipPlus4 = 20 characters.<br/><br/>displayLevelCode: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*dobInformationInput*: Used to set recipient date of birth information and consists of:<br/><br/>*dateOfBirth*: Specifies the recipient's date, month and year of birth.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn4InformationInput*: Used to set the last four digits of the recipient's SSN information and consists of:<br/><br/>*ssn4*: Specifies the last four digits of the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn9InformationInput*: Used to set the recipient's SSN information. Note that the ssn9 information can never be returned in the response. The ssn9 input consists of:<br/><br/><br/><br/>*ssn9*: Specifies the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay. |
      | inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration | No | Boolean | Optional element. If true and the template recipient creates a DocuSign account after signing, the Manage Account Email Notification settings are used as the default settings for the recipient's account. |
      | note | No | String | A note that is unique to this recipient. This note is sent to the recipient via the signing email. The note displays in the signing UI near the upper left corner of the document on the signing screen.<br/>Maximum Length: 1000 characters. |
      | phoneAuthentication | No | RecipientPhoneAuthentication | Optional element. Contains the elements: <br/><br/> *recipMayProvideNumber*:Boolean. When set to **true** thenrecipient can use whatever phone number they choose to.<br/><br/> *senderProvidedNumbers*: ArrayOfString. A list of phone numbers the recipient can use. <br/><br/>*recordVoicePrint* - Reserved <br/><br/>*validateRecipProvidedNumber* - Reserved| |

    \  | Description |\n| :-------              | :---------- |\n| Approve Tab   \
    \        | Place this tab on the document if you want the recipient to approve\
    \ documents in an envelope without placing a signature or initials on the document.\
    \ If the recipient clicks the Approve tab during the signing process, the recipient\
    \ is considered to have signed the document. No information is shown on the document\
    \ for the approval, but it is recorded as a signature in the envelope history.\
    \ |\n| Checkbox Tab          | Place this tab on the document in a location where\
    \ the recipient can select a yes/no (on/off) type option. |\n| Company Tab   \
    \        | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's company\
    \ name to appear. |\n| Date Signed Tab       | Place this tab on the document\
    \ where you want the date the recipient signed the document to appear. |\n| Date\
    \ Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient\
    \ to enter a date. Date tabs are single-line fields that allow date information\
    \ to be entered in any format. The tooltip for this tab recommends entering the\
    \ date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced. The format entered by the signer\
    \ is retained. If you need a particular date format enforced, DocuSign recommends\
    \ using a Text tab with a Validation Pattern and Validation Message to enforce\
    \ the format. |\n| Decline Tab           | Place this tab on the document where\
    \ you want to give the recipient the option of declining an envelope. If the recipient\
    \ clicks the Decline tab during the signing process, the envelope is voided. |\n\
    | Email Address Tab     | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's\
    \ email, as entered in the recipient information, to appear. |\n| Email Tab  \
    \           | This is a single-line field that accepts all characters. |\n| Envelope\
    \ ID Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want the envelope ID\
    \ for to appear. Recipients cannot enter or change the information in this tab.\
    \ It is for informational purposes only. |\n| First Name Tab        | Place this\
    \ tab on a document where you want the recipient's first name to appear. This\
    \ tab splits the recipient's name (as entered in the recipient information) into\
    \ sections based on spaces and uses the first section as the first name. |\n|\
    \ Formula Tab           | This tab is used to add a calculated field to a document.\
    \ Envelope recipients cannot directly enter information into the tab. The formula\
    \ tab calculates and displays a new value when changes are made to the reference\
    \ tab values. The reference tab information and calculation operations are entered\
    \ in the \"formula\" element. See the Using the Calculated Fields Feature quick\
    \ start guide or DocuSign Service User Guide for more information about formulas.\
    \  |\n| Full Name Tab         | Place this tab on the document where you want\
    \ the recipient's full name to appear. |\n| Initial Here Tab      | Place this\
    \ tab where the recipient must initial the document. This tab can be set to be\
    \ optional.  |\n| Last Name Tab         | Place this tab on a document where you\
    \ want the recipient's last name to appear. This tab splits the recipient's name\
    \ (as entered in the recipient information) into sections based on spaces and\
    \ uses the last section as the last name. |\n| List Tab              | This tab\
    \ has a list of options that a recipient can select. The `listItems` parameter\
    \ is used to set the options that can be selected.  |\n| Note Tab            \
    \  | Place this tab on the document where you want to add a note for the recipient\
    \ on a document. |\n| Number Tab            | This tab is a field where the recipient\
    \ can enter numbers and decimal (.) points.  |\n| Radio Group Tab       | This\
    \ group tab is used to place radio buttons on a document. The `radios` parameter\
    \ is used to add and place the radio buttons associated with the group. Only one\
    \ radio button can be selected in a group.  |\n| Sign Here Tab         | Place\
    \ this tab where the recipient must sign the document. This tab can be set to\
    \ be optional.  |\n| Signer Attachment Tab | The signer attachment is where the\
    \ recipient initiates the process of adding supporting documents to an envelope.\
    \ |\n| SSN Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient\
    \ can enter numbers. A Social Security Number can be typed with or without dashes.\
    \ |\n| Text Tab              | This tab is a field where the recipient can enter\
    \ any type of characters.  |\n| Title Tab             | Place this tab on the\
    \ document where you want the recipient's title to appear. |\n| Zip Tab      \
    \         | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers.\
    \ |\n\n\n## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes and Templates \n\nCustom Tabs can be\
    \ added to envelopes and templates\nby setting the `customTabId` property\nwhen\
    \ creating an envelope or template recipient\nor when adding a new tab for an\
    \ existing recipient.\nThe custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.\n\
    For example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number tab.\n\
    \nWhen the `customTabId` property is set,\nthe new tab inherits all the custom\
    \ tab properties.\nRequired information that is not included in the custom tab,\n\
    such as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.\nIf the\
    \ custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions must be included.\n\
    \nAfter the tab is created,\nit is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting.\
    \ \n\n## Anchoring Tabs\n\nThe tab anchoring option\nallows you to send documents\
    \ for signature\nthat do not have a fixed layout or format.\nIn these documents\
    \ you might not know\nthe absolute location of the tabs\nwhen you design your\
    \ API client application because the tabs must move with text.\nAs an alternative\
    \ to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,\nthe DocuSign Service can derive an\
    \ anchor location for the tab\nby correlating anchor information to data within\
    \ the document.\n\nWhen the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains\
    \ tabs\nwith anchor information,\nit searches the document for instances of the\
    \ `anchorString` property.\nWhen found,\nit places a tab of the specified type\
    \ for the designated recipient.\nTab positions are established by setting offsets\
    \ for the tab.\n\nWhen you apply tabs to the document,\nDocuSign does not remove\
    \ or replace the text in the `anchorString` property. You can hide codified anchors\
    \ by using the same font color as the background of the document. So the anchor\
    \ can be used by DocuSign processes and it will not be visible on the document.\n\
    \nTo use an anchoring option:\n\n1. Identify the location in the document by text\
    \ string. You can use a pre-existing text string or add a new one.\nFor best performance\
    \ DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings when possible, especially\
    \ when there are a large number of pages in the envelope. \nFor example, you might\
    \ want to add a Sign Here tab to the \"Borrower's Signature\" lines in a document,\
    \ but that phrase might occur in places in the document where you don't want to\
    \ tab to appear. In this case, you could add the text \"BorrowerSignHere\" in\
    \ white font color (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you\
    \ want Sign Here tabs to appear and use \"BorrowerSignHere\" as the anchor string.\
    \ \n1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.\n\
    1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should\
    \ be placed. \n\nSetting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves\
    \ the tab right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove\
    \ moves the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units\
    \ used for the offsets.\nFor Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of\
    \ the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the\
    \ tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nFor all other tabs the bottom-left\
    \ of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the top-left of the\
    \ tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nDocuSign does not currently provide\
    \ tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely\
    \ require some trial-and-error.\n\n### Rules for working with anchor tags\n\n\
    When anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for the\
    \ `anchorString` property.\n\n* You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString`\
    \ property. DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString`\
    \ property within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique\
    \ anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.\n* You cannot use the\
    \ same anchored tab for different recipients for the same document.\n* The DocuSign\
    \ system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image when checking for\
    \ anchor strings.\n* X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances\
    \ of the tab in the document. To use different offsets at different locations\
    \ in the document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.\n\
    * If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of the page\
    \ boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X offset value places\
    \ a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error message `Invalid_User_Offset`\
    \ is sent. The error message includes the X offset that resulted in the error.\n\
    * The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object\
    \ in the document.\n* The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the\
    \ anchor tabs. It is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient\
    \ white space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.\n\n###\
    \ Tips and Tricks\n\nThe following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:\n\
    * In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an `anchorString`\
    \ property and the text that naturally exists in documents, establish a codified\
    \ syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a\
    \ document.\n* Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across\
    \ multiple document types.\n* Especially for documents that have variable numbers\
    \ of tabs or signers, author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs\
    \ for all potential signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually\
    \ placed by including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach\
    \ allows a single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining\
    \ separate documents for each scenario.\n\n## Automatically Populating Tabs\n\n\
    If you want similar tab types\nto automatically populate with the same data,\n\
    you must follow these guidelines:\n\n* Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters\n\
    \  `\\\\*` in front of the label.\n  If you omit the `\\\\*` prefix,\n  only the\
    \ first occurrence of the tab is populated.\n\n  When automatically populating\
    \ tabs,\n  the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.\n  In the JSON example\
    \ below,\n  the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`\n\
    \  will be auto-populated as specified (\"Doe\" and \"John\")\n  each place they\
    \ appear throughout the envelope.\n\n  ```\n  \"tabs\": {\n    \"textTabs\": [\n\
    \    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentLastName\",\n      \"value\": \"Doe\"\
    \n    },\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentFirstName\",\n      \"value\"\
    : \"John\"\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n* Each occurrence of the tab must have identical\
    \ properties.\n\n  For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,\n\
    \  each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.\n  If one tab has the `bold` property set\
    \ to **true**,\n  and the other has the `bold` property set to **false**,\n  only\
    \ the first one will be populated.\n  In order to automatically populate both\
    \ occurrences\n  of the `Name` Text tabs,\n  the `bold` property must be set to\
    \ the same value for both tabs.\n"

  - name: PowerForms
    description: |
      PowerForms enable you to create self-service documents for signature. A PowerForm is an envelope initiated from a URL that you make available for signers to complete. You can either add a PowerForm to your website or email the URL to recipients. DocuSign saves the data that recipients enter so  you can easily integrate it with your other applications.

      For more information, see [Using PowerForms](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-using-powerforms).

      **Note**: PowerForms are available only for DocuSign Enterprise accounts.


      ### Errors

      PowerForm methods return the following 404 errors:

      - `PowerForms_Recipient_Denied_Documents`: The recipient is denied access to the documents.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Shared_Tabs_Not_Allowed`: Shared tags are not allowed because a digital certificate is required
      for a signer.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Free_Form_Tabs_Not_Allowed`: Signers that are required to use a digital certificate must have at
      least one required, non-conditional signature or initials tab.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Multiple_Recipients_Routing_Order`: Signers that are required to use a digital certificate must be the
      only recipient in a routing order. Edit the routing order or remove the digital certificate requirement.
      - `PowerForms_DigitalCerts_Markup_Not_Allowed`: Document markup is not allowed because a digital certificate is
      required for a signer.
      - `PowerForms_Incomplete_Recipient`: The recipient's username, email, or role is not set.
      - `PowerForms_PowerFormId_Required`: A `powerFormId` is required.

  - name: BulkSend
    description: |
      You can use bulk send lists for anything that you need to send to a large number of recipients on a
      recurring basis, such as:

      - Compliance letters (privacy, security, and ethics consent forms)
      - New hire onboarding documents (benefits, transit, and parking information and payroll forms)
      - Other Human Resources documents
      - Event-related forms

      The API creates a separate copy of the envelope for each recipient that you specify. Each instance of the envelope is called a
      `BulkCopy`. You can use a bulk send list to send up to 1,000 copies per call.

      After you create a bulk send list, it persists and can be reused and edited any number of times.

      ## Customizing Bulk Send Lists

      You can customize individual copies of the envelope. For example, you can customize the email notification and
      language and add personalized notes.

      For example, if one recipient prefers to access their DocuSign envelopes behind an access code, and another prefers her
      email in French, you can implement those customizations.

      ## Using Bulk Send

      The bulk send feature uses the following flow:

      1. Create a draft envelope by calling the [Envelopes::createEnvelope][createEnvelope] method. Add placeholders for bulk send information to the envelope, including:
          - Email address placeholders.
          - Tab placeholders. Assign `tabLabels` to these placeholders that will make sense for matching the tabs to values in the bulk send list. For example, if you're sending a field trip permission slip to parents, you might create a placeholder text tab called `StudentName` that will you will then populate with the names of individual students in the bulk send list. You can use the following types of text tabs, radio group tabs, and list tabs to match bulk send recipients to an envelope.
          - Any envelope custom fields. These fields must match the envelope custom fields in envelope copies in the bulk send list.
      2. Create a bulk send list by using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendList][create_list] method.
      3. (Optional) Test compatibility. Use the [BulkSend::createBulkSendTestRequest][create_test] method to test your bulk
         send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send. For example, a template that has
         three roles is not compatible with a bulk send list that has only two recipients. For this reason, you might want to
         test compatibility first. A successful test result returns the Boolean value `true`. An unsuccessful test returns a
         JSON response that contains information about the errors that occurred.
      4. Send your envelope to the list by using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendRequest][create_request] method. The response
         returns a `batchId` that you can use for tracking and other purposes.

      The API creates and queues your envelopes asynchronously behind the scenes. You can get the status of the batch by
      using the [BulkEnvelopes_GetBulkEnvelopesBatchId][getbulkenv] method, passing in the `batchId`.

      To get the envelopes generated for the `batchId`, use the [Envelopes:listStatusChanges][GetEnvelopes] method, passing in
      a `custom_field` named `BulkBatchId` where the value is the `batchId` that was returned in step 4.

      Example:

      `custom_field=BulkBatchId={{batchId}}`

      **Bulk Send Requirements and Limitations**

      * Bulk send must be enabled for your account (in the `accountSettingsInformation` object, `enableBulkRecipient` must be set to **true**) and for the user sending the envelopes (the `allowBulkRecipients` property in `userSettings` must be set to **true**).
      * You can include up to 1,000 bulk recipients in each request.
      * When you send an envelope with bulk recipients, envelopes are added to a bulk recipient queue and sent in a metered fashion. An account can have a total of 2,000 total envelopes in the queue at a time.  If this limit is reached, an error message displays to the sender. If you receive this error, wait and resend the envelope at a later time.

      If you frequently run into queue limits, contact your account manager to discuss modifying the queue limits for your account.

        Response

        The response returns the billing plan information, including the currency code, for the plan. The `billingPlan` and `succesorPlans` property values are the same as those shown in the [Billing::getBillingPlan](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/Billing/BillingPlans/get) reference. the `billingAddress` and `creditCardInformation` property values are the same as those shown in the [Billing::updatePlan](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/Billing/BillingPlans/update) reference.

        **Note**: When credit card number information displays, a mask is applied to the response so that only the last 4 digits of the card number are visible.

        | BULK_SEND_MAX_COPIES_EXCEEDED                           | A bulk sending list cannot specify more than XXX copies in the mailing list.

      summary: Creates a bulk send request
      description: |+
        This method initiates the bulk send process. It generates a bulk send request based on an [existing bulk send list][create_list] and an envelope or template.

        Consider using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendTestRequest][create_test] method to test your bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send first. To learn about the complete bulk send flow, see the [Bulk Send overview][BulkSendOverview].

        If the envelopes were successfully queued for asynchronous processing, the response contains a `batchId` that you can use to get the status of the batch. If a failure occurs, the API returns an error message.

      summary: Creates a bulk send test
      description: |+
        This method tests a bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send. For example, a template that has three roles is not compatible with a bulk send list that has only two recipients. For this reason, you might want to test compatibility first.

        A successful test result returns `true` for the `canBeSent` property. An unsuccessful test returns a JSON response that contains information about the errors that occurred.

        If the test is successful, you can then send the envelope or template by using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendRequest][BulkSendRequest] method.

        ## Envelope Compatibility Checks

        This section describes the envelope compatibility checks that the system performs.

        **Top-Level Issues**

        - Envelopes must be in a sendable state.
        - The bulk send list must contain at least one copy (instance of an envelope), and no more than the maximum number of copies allowed for the account.
        - The envelope must not be null and must be visible to the current user.
        - The account cannot have more queued envelopes than the maximum number configured for the account.
        - The bulk send list must exist.

        **Recipients**

        - The envelope must have recipients.
        - If you are using an envelope, all of the recipients defined in the bulk send list must have corresponding recipient IDs in the envelope definition. If you are using a template, you must either match the recipient IDs or role IDs.
        - The envelope cannot contain a bulk recipient (an artifact of the legacy version of DocuSign's bulk send
          functionality).

        **Recipient Tabs**

        - Every `recipient ID, tab label` pair in the bulk send list must correspond to a tab in the envelope.

        **Custom Fields**

        - Each envelope-level custom field in the bulk send list must correspond to the name of a `customField` in the
          envelope definition. You do not have to match the recipient-level custom fields.

      summary: Gets status changes for one or more envelopes.
      description: "Retrieves a list of envelopes that match your request. \nA large\
        \ set of optional filters let you filter\nby date,\nby envelope ID,\nor by\
        \ status codes.\n\nYour request must include one or more of the following\
        \ parameters:\n\n* `from_date`\n* `envelope_ids`\n* `transaction_ids`\n\n\n\
        Getting envelope status using `transaction_ids` is useful\nfor offline signing\
        \ situations where it can be used\ndetermine if an envelope was created or\
        \ not. It can be used\nfor the cases where a network connection was lost,\
        \ before\nthe envelope status could be returned.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary database\
        \ queries, the DocuSign\nsignature platform first checks requests to ensure\
        \ that the\nfilter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response\n\
        before querying the database. \n\nFor example, for a request with a `from_to_status`\
        \ of\n`delivered` and a current `status` of `created,sent`,\nDocuSign will\
        \ always return an empty list. \nThis is because the request translates to:\
        \ find the\nenvelopes that were delivered between the `from_date` and\n`to_date`\
        \ dates that have a current status of `created` or\n`sent`. Since an envelope\
        \ that has been delivered can\nnever have a status of `created` or `sent`,\
        \ a zero-size\nresponse would be generated. \nIn this case, DocuSign does\
        \ not query the database\nand returns an empty list immediately.\n\n\nThe\
        \ following table shows the valid current envelope\nstatuses (`status` parameter)\
        \ for the different status\nqualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the\
        \ request. If\nthe status and status qualifiers in the API request do not\n\
        contain any of the values shown in the Valid Current\nStatuses column, then\
        \ an empty list is returned.\n\nClient applications should check that the\
        \ statuses (`status`\nparameter) they are requesting make sense for a given\n\
        `from_to_status` parameter value.\n\n| Status Qualifier<br>(`from_to_status`)\
        \ | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                  \

            Although you can use any date format
            supported by the .NET system library's
            [`DateTime.Parse()`][msoft] function,
            DocuSign recommends
            using [ISO 8601][] format dates
            with an explicit time zone offset
            If you do not provide
            a time zone offset,
            the method uses the server's time zone.

            For example, the following dates and times refer to the same instant:

            * `2017-05-01T21:44-04:00`

            to stop looking for status changes.
            The default is the current date and time.

            Although you can use any date format
            supported by the .NET system library's
            [`DateTime.Parse()`][msoft] function,
            DocuSign recommends
            using [ISO 8601][] format dates
            with an explicit time zone offset
            If you do not provide
            a time zone offset,
            the method uses the server's time zone.

            For example, the following dates and times refer to the same instant:

            * `2017-05-02T01:44Z`
            * `2017-05-01T21:44-04:00`

      summary: Creates an envelope.
      description: |
        Creates and sends an envelope or creates a draft envelope.
        Envelopes are fundamental resources in the DocuSign platform.

        With this method you can:

        * Create and send an envelope
          with [documents][], [recipients][], and [tabs][].
        * [Create and send an envelope from a template](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/).
        * [Create and send an envelope from
          a combination of documents and templates](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/templates/composite/).
        * Create a draft envelope.


        When you use this method
        to create and send an envelope
        in a single request,
        the following parameters in the request body (an [`envelopeDefinition`][envelopeDefinition]) are required:

        | Parameter      | Description |
        | :--------      | :---------- |
        | `status`       | Set to `sent` to send the envelope to recipients.<br>Set to `created` (or don't set at all) to save the envelope as a draft. |
        | `emailSubject` | The subject of the email used to send the envelope. |
        | `documents`    | The [documents][] to be signed. |
        | `recipients`   | The email addresses of the envelope [recipients][]. |


        **Note**: If the envelope has a workflow definition
        and the `workflowStatus` is `paused`,
        the envelope will not be sent immediately,
        even if the envelope's `status` is `sent`.

        There are many ways to use envelopes.
        You can create and send an envelope
        with a single API request,
        or you can use several API requests
        to create, populate, and send envelopes.

            For some documents, one or more signatures must be witnessed by an appointed [notary public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public).

            DocuSign supports eNotary services for many jurisdictions. This example demonstrates how to send an envelope to be signed by Susan Signer with her signature witnessed by Nancy Notary. You must know the name and email address of the signer and the notary public for a signature to be notarized.

            Note that the full legal name of the signer must be used. It will be checked against the signer's government-issued proof of identity by the notary public.

            Please see the [DocuSign eNotary resource page](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-enotary-resources) for further information. It lists the jurisdictions participating in the DocuSign eNotary program and additional reference information.

            Note that eNotary services are not included with all account types and are **not** included by default with demo/developer sandbox accounts. To enable eNotary service for your sandbox account, contact your DocuSign technical support person or DocuSign customer service.

            The example includes event notification via the Connect service.

            DocuSign enables document signers use
            [electronic](https://www.docusign.com/products/electronic-signature) or
            [digital](https://www.docusign.com/how-it-works/electronic-signature/digital-signature) signatures.

            DocuSign has tightly integrated standard digital signatures into the DocuSign Signature platform. This enables a single envelope to include:

            * electronic signatures,
            * AES digital signatures using certificates from DocuSign or from your organization,
            * QES digital signatures from government certified Trust Service Providers (TSPs).

            This example enables the signer to create an eIDAS compliant AES signature with embedded signing. InPerson signers can also use SBS digital signatures.

            [More information on creating SBS digital signature requests.](/esign-rest-api/guides/standards-based-signatures)

            The `clientId` in the example tells DocuSign that the Signing Ceremony will be embedded.
            The example also includes an `eventNotification` object for receiving envelope status updates from DocuSign.

            ## Embedding the signing ceremony
            1. Send the `Envelopes: create` call as shown below in the Request/Response section.
            2. The response will include the `envelopeId`
            3. Use the [EnvelopeViews: createRecipient](../../EnvelopeViews/createRecipient) request to obtain the redirectURL as follows:

            `POST /v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/views/recipient`

            ````
            {
                "clientUserId": "1000",
                "email": "Sam@spade.com",
                "userName": "Sam Spade",
                "returnUrl": "https://your_app.example.com",
                "AuthenticationMethod": "Password"
            }
            ````
            The response will include the `url`. Redirect the user's browser to the url to start the signing ceremony.

            **Note**: You must **immediately** redirect the user to the url you receive from DocuSign. The url is only valid for 5 minutes. Don't request a recipient view url until you are ready to redirect the user's browser.

      summary: Send, void, or modify a draft envelope. Purge documents from a completed
        envelope.
      description: |-
        This method enables you to make changes to an envelope.
        You can use it to:

        * Send a draft envelope
        * Void an in-process envelope
        * Modify a draft envelope
        * Purge documents and envelope metadata from the DocuSign platform


        <div class="highlight highlight-info">
        <p markdown="1">

        Although the request body for this method
        is a complete envelope definition,
        you only need to provide
        the properties that
        you're updating.

        </p>
        </div>


        ## Sending a Draft Envelope

        To send a draft envelope, include the following code in the request body:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "sent"
        }
        ```

        You can attach a workflow before sending the envelope:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "sent",
          "workflow": {
            "workflowSteps": [
              {
                "action": "pause_before",
                "description": "pause_before routing order 2",
                "itemId": 2,
                "triggerOnItem": "routing_order"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Working with Workflows

        To unpause a workflow, the request body should include this:

        ```json
        {
          "workflow": {
            "workflowStatus": "in_progress"
          }
        }
        ```

        ## Voiding an In-Process Envelope

        To void an in-process envelope, include the following code in the request body:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "voided",
          "voidedReason": "The reason for voiding the envelope"
        }
        ```

        ## Modifying Envelope Email Information

        To change the email subject and message of a draft envelope,
        include the following code in the request body:

        ```json
        {
          "emailSubject": "new email subject",
          "emailBlurb": "new email message"
        }
        ```

        ## Purging Documents from DocuSign


        To place only the documents
        in the purge queue,
        leaving any
        corresponding attachments
        and tabs in the DocuSign platform,
        set the `purgeState` property
        to `documents_queued`.


        ```json
        {
          "purgeState": "documents_queued"
        }
        ```

        To place documents,
        attachments,
        and tabs
        in the purge queue,
        set the `purgeState` property
        to `documents_and_metadata_queued`.

        ```json
        {
          "purgeState": "documents_and_metadata_queued"
        }
        ```


        You can purge documents
        only from completed envelopes
        that are not marked as the authoritative copy.
        The user requesting the purge
        must have permission to purge documents
        and
        must be the sender or be acting on behalf of the sender.



        When the purge request is initiated
        the items to be purged
        are placed in the purge queue
        for deletion in 14 days.
        The sender
        and
        all recipients with DocuSign accounts
        associated with the envelope
        get an email notification
        the the documents will be deleted in 14 days.
        The notification contains a link
        to the documents.
        A second email notification
        is sent 7 days later.
        At the end of the 14-day period
        the documents are deleted from the system.
        Recipients without DocuSign accounts
        do not receive email notifications.


        If your account has a Document Retention policy,
        envelope documents
        are automatically placed
        in the purge queue,
        and notification emails are sent
        at the end of the retention period.
        Setting a Document Retention policy is the same as setting a
        schedule for purging documents.

        ## Removing Documents from the Purge Queue

        To remove documents from the purge queue, include the following code in the request body:

        ```
        {
          "purgeState": "documents_dequeued"
        }
        ```

The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.

        There are two types of envelope custom fields, text, and list. A text custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. With a list custom field, the sender selects the value of the field from a pre-made list.

        ### Important: The BCC Email address feature is designed to provide a copy of all email communications for external archiving purposes. DocuSign recommends that envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature, including the BCC Email Override option, include additional signer authentication options. To send a copy of the envelope to a recipient who does not need to sign, use a Carbon Copy or Certified Delivery recipient type.

      summary: Locks an envelope.
      description: |+
        This method locks the specified envelope and sets the time until
        the lock expires to prevent other users or recipients from
        changing the envelope.

        **Note**: To use this method, the envelope locking
        capability must be enabled for the user; that is, the user setting
        `canLockEnvelopes` must be set to **true**.

        The response to this request includes a `lockToken` parameter
        that you must use in the `X-DocuSign-Edit` header for
        every PUT method (typically a method that updates an envelope)
        while the envelope is locked.


        If you do not provide the `lockToken` when accessing
        a locked envelope, you will get the following
        error:

        ```
        {
           "errorCode": "EDIT_LOCK_NOT_LOCK_OWNER",
           "message": "The user is not the owner of the lock. The template is locked by another user or in another application"
        }
        ```


        ### The X-DocuSign-Edit header

        The `X-DocuSign-Edit` header looks like this
        and can be specified in either JSON or XML.

        **JSON**
        ```
        {
          "LockToken": "token-from-response",
          "LockDurationInSeconds": "600"
        }
        ```

        **XML**
        ```
        <DocuSignEdit>
          <LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken>
          <LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds>
        </DocuSignEdit>
        ```

        In the actual HTTP header, you would remove the linebreaks:

        ```
        X-DocuSign-Edit: {"LockToken": "token-from-response", "LockDurationInSeconds": "600" }
            or
        X-DocuSign-Edit:<DocuSignEdit><LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken><LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds></DocuSignEdit>
        ```

      summary: Returns a URL to the recipient view UI.
      description: "Returns a URL that enables you to embed the recipient view of\
        \ the DocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer, then\
        \ the view will provide the signing ceremony.\n\n**Note**: Please redirect\
        \ the client to the URL. iFrames should not be used, especially if the recipient\
        \ is using a mobile or tablet. \n\nThis method is only used with envelopes\
        \ in the `sent` status.\n\nYour application is responsible for authenticating\
        \ the identity of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the\
        \ parameters `assertionId`, `authenticationInstant`, `authenticationMethod`,\
        \ `clientUserId`, and `securityDomain` to record information on how the recipient\
        \ was authenticated. At a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId`\
        \ are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope's\
        \ certificate of completion.\n\n## Redirects\nAfter the signer completes or\
        \ ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user's browser back\
        \ to your app via the `returnUrl` that you supply. (The user is redirected\
        \ through a different subdomain, depending on the region of the account sending\
        \ the envelope. Please [verify your domain whitelist](https://www.docusign.com/trust/security/whitelists).)\
        \ \n\n### The event status parameter\nDocuSign appends an `event` query parameter\
        \ to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app can use this\
        \ event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Do not fetch\
        \ the envelope status by using Envelopes::get or a similar method because\
        \ doing so could break the DocuSign rule against polling.\n\n**Note**: Because\
        \ a user can cancel redirection, close their browser after signing, or spoof\
        \ the landing URL. Hitting the `ReturnUrl` should not be the single source\
        \ of truth for envelope status for your integration.\n\n## The URL is time-limited\n\
        The URL returned by this method is valid for one use, and you must use or\
        \ display it within a couple of minutes after it is generated. AFter the recipient\
        \ is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign\
        \ system periodically or their session will time out.\n\nBecause the URL is\
        \ time-limited, it should not be stored or sent through email. After you receive\
        \ it, immediately redirect the user's browser to the URL.\n\nIf you want to\
        \ invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation's\
        \ URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a\
        \ recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.\n\
        \n## Maintaining State\nAfter the recipient completes the recipient view (or\
        \ signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application\
        \ can recover state information about the transaction by storing information\
        \ in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the `returnUrl` field.\
        \ Eg, `https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState=12345` When the user is\
        \ redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will be appended. In\
        \ this example, prevent spoofing by not using a guessable value as the state\
        \ value.\n\n**Note**: You can revoke the URL by making the DELETE call to\
        \ the same URL with no request body. "

        Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group. You can associate a group with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions for users in that group without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user. You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but it makes it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. You can also use groups with template sharing to limit user access to templates.

      summary: Creates a new PowerForm
      description: |+
        This method creates a new PowerForm.

        You create a PowerForm from an existing DocuSign [template](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/templates/templates/create/), based on the `templateId` in the request body.

         PowerForms that you create from a template are referred to as *web PowerForms*.

        **Note**: The RADmin console also supports creating a PowerForm by uploading a PDF file that has active form fields (referred to as a *PDF PowerForm*). However, PDF PowerForms are deprecated and are not supported in the API.

        **Note**: A PowerForm can have only one sender. (Because PowerForms are not necessarily sent by email, this user is also referred to as the PowerForm *initiator*.) If you need to associate multiple senders with a PowerForm, create multiple copies of the PowerForm by using the same template (one copy for each sender). By default, the sender is the PowerForm Administrator who creates the PowerForm.


        ### Signing modes

        You can use one of the following signing modes for a PowerForm:

        **`email`**

        This mode verifies the recipient's identity by using email authentication before the recipient can sign a document. The recipient enters their email address on the landing page and then clicks **Begin Signing** to begin the signing process. The system then sends an email message with a validation code to the recipient. If the recipient does not provide a valid email address, they do not receive the email message containing the access code and are not able to open and sign the document.

        Alternatively, you can make the process easier for signers by using email authentication only and omitting the access code. To do this, you append the `activateonly` flag to the PowerForm URL and set it to true by passing in the value `1`.  When the flag is active, the first recipient receives an email with a link that initiates the signing session without having to enter access code.

        Example: `activateonly=1`

        **`direct`**

        This mode does not require any verification. After a recipient enters their email address on the landing page and clicks **Begin Signing**, a new browser tab opens and the recipient can immediately begin the signing process.

        Because the `direct` signing mode does not verify the recipient's identity by using email authentication, we strongly recommend that you use this mode only when the PowerForm is accessible behind a secure portal where the recipient's identity is already authenticated, or where another form of authentication is specified for the recipient in the DocuSign template (for example, an access code, phone authentication, or ID check).

        **Note**: In the account settings, `enablePowerFormDirect` must be **true** to use `direct` as the `signingMode`.

        ### Redirect URLs

        You can control the URL to which signers are redirected after signing your PowerForm. However, the URL is specified elsewhere, outside of the PowerForm creation process. For details, see [How do I specify a URL to redirect to when a PowerForm is completed?](https://support.docusign.com/en/articles/How-do-I-specify-a-URL-to-redirect-to-when-a-Powerform-is-completed).

      description: |
        This method creates a BCC email archive configuration for an account (adds a BCC email address to the account for archiving the emails that DocuSign generates).

        The only property that you must set in the request body is the BCC email address that you want to use.

        **Note**: An account can have up to five active and pending email archive addresses combined, but you must use this method to add them to the account one at a time. Each email address is considered a separate BCC email archive configuration.

        This sets the shared access status for one or more users or templates.

        When setting user shared access, only users with account administration privileges can set shared access status for envelopes.

        When setting template shared access, only users who own a template and have sharing permission or with account administration privileges can set shared access for templates.

        Changes to the shared items status are not additive. The change always replaces the current status.

        To change template shared access, add the query parameter `item_type` = `templates` to the request. When this is set, the user and envelopes properties are not required.

        **Note**: This functionality is a newer version of the [Update Group Share](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/Templates/Templates/updateGroupShare) functionality.

        Retrieves a list of supported languages that you can set for an individual recipient when creating an envelope, as well as their simple type enumeration values. These are the languages that you can set for the standard email format and signing view for each recipient.

        For example, in the recipient's email notification, this setting affects elements such as the standard introductory text describing the request to sign. It also determines the language used for buttons and tabs in both the email notification and the signing experience.

        **Note**: Setting a language for a recipient affects only the DocuSign standard text. Any custom text that you enter for the `emailBody` and `emailSubject` of the notification is not translated, and appears exactly as you enter it.

      summary: Creates one or more templates.
      description: "Creates one or more template definitions, using a multipart request\
        \ for each template.\n\nTemplates help streamline the sending process when\
        \ you frequently send the same or similar documents, or send different documents\
        \ to the same group of people.\n\nWhen you create a template, you define placeholder\
        \ roles. Rather than specifying a person, you specify a role that regularly\
        \ participates in a transaction that uses the template. Then, when you create\
        \ or send an envelope based on the template, you assign actual recipients\
        \ to the template roles. The recipients automatically inherit all of the workflow\
        \ that is defined for that role in the template, such as the tabs and routing\
        \ information.\n\nFor code examples and more information, see [REST API Templates](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/features/templates#sending-from-a-template).\n\
        \n## Template Email Subject Merge Fields\n\nPlaceholder roles have associated\
        \ merge fields that personalize the email notification that DocuSign sends.\
        \ For example, the template automatically personalizes the email message by\
        \ adding placeholders for the recipient's name and email address within the\
        \ email subject line, based on the recipient's role. When the sender adds\
        \ the name and email information for the recipient and sends the envelope,\
        \ the recipient information is automatically merged into the appropriate fields\
        \ in the email subject line.\n\nBoth the sender and the recipients will see\
        \ the information in the email subject line for any emails associated with\
        \ the template. This provides an easy way for senders to organize their envelope\
        \ emails without having to open an envelope to find out who the recipient\
        \ is.\n\n**Warning: If merging the recipient information into the subject\
        \ line causes the subject line to exceed 100 characters, then any characters\
        \ over the 100 character limit are not included in the subject line. For cases\
        \ where you expect the recipient name or email to be long, you should consider\
        \ placing the merge field at the start of the email subject.**\n\nTo insert\
        \ a recipient's name into the subject line, add the following text in the\
        \ `emailSubject` property when you create the template:\n\n`[[<roleName>_UserName]]`\n\
        \nExample:\n\n`\"emailSubject\":\"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this\
        \ NDA\",`\n\nTo add a recipient's email address in the subject line, add the\
        \ following text in the `emailSubject` property when you create the template\
        \ or send an envelope from the template:\n\n`[[<roleName>_Email]]`\n\nExample:\n\
        \n`\"emailSubject\":\"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA\",`\n\nIn these\
        \ examples, the role name specified in the template  is “Signer 1”.  When\
        \ the envelope is sent, the placeholder will be dynamically substituted with\
        \ the recipient's name or email.\n\n## Creating multiple templates\n\nTo create\
        \ multiple templates, you provide a zip file of JSON files. You can also use\
        \ the Templates::ListTemplates method with the `is_download` query parameter\
        \ to download a zip file containing your existing templates and use that as\
        \ a guide. The API supports both .zip and .gzip file formats as input.\n\n\
        You also need to set the following headers:\n\n- `Content-Length`\n- `Content-Type`\n\
        - `Content-Disposition`\n\nExample: \n\n`Content-Length: 71068`\n\n`Content-Type:\
        \ application/zip`\n\n`Content-Disposition: file; filename=\"DocuSignTemplates_Nov_25_2019_20_40_21.zip\"\
        ; fileExtension=.zip`"

        [responsive](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/responsive/),
        HTML version of a specific template document. This
        method enables you to preview a PDF document
        conversion to responsive HTML across device types
        prior to sending.

        The request body is a `documentHtmlDefinition`
        object, which holds the responsive signing
        parameters that define how to generate the HTML
        version of the signing document.

      summary: Locks a template.
      description: |+
        This method locks the specified template and sets the time until
        the lock expires to prevent other users or recipients from
        changing the template.

        **Note**: To use this method, the envelope locking
        capability must be enabled for the user; that is, the user setting
        `canLockEnvelopes` must be set to **true**.

        The response to this request includes a `lockToken` parameter
        that you must use in the `X-DocuSign-Edit` header for
        every PUT method (typically a method that updates a template)
        while the template is locked.


        If you do not provide the `lockToken` when accessing
        a locked template, you will get the following
        error:

        ```
        {
           "errorCode": "EDIT_LOCK_NOT_LOCK_OWNER",
           "message": "The user is not the owner of the lock. The template is locked by another user or in another application"
        }
        ```


        ### The X-DocuSign-Edit header

        The `X-DocuSign-Edit` header looks like this
        and can be specified in either JSON or XML.

        **JSON**
        ```
        {
          "LockToken": "token-from-response",
          "LockDurationInSeconds": "600"
        }
        ```

        **XML**
        ```
        <DocuSignEdit>
          <LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken>

            or

        Deletes the lock from the specified template.
        The user deleting the lock must be the same user
        who locked the template.

        You must include the `X-DocuSign-Edit` header
        as described in
        [TemplateLocks: create](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/templates/templatelocks/create/).

        This method takes an optional query paramter
        that lets you specify whether
        changes made while the template was locked
        are kept or discarded.


        | Query Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |

        Adds new users to an account.

        The body of this request is an array of `newUsers` objects. For each new user, you must provide at least the `userName` and `email` properties.

        The `userSettings` property specifies the actions users can perform. In the example below, Tal Mason will be able to send envelopes, and the activation email will be in French because the `locale` is set to `fr`.


        ```
        POST /restapi/v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/users
        Content-Type: application/json
        ```
        ```
        {
          "newUsers": [
            {
              "userName": "Claire Horace",
              "email": "claire@example.com"
            },
            {
              "userName": "Tal Mason",
              "email": "talmason@example.com",
              "company": "TeleSel",
              "userSettings": {
                "locale": "fr",
                "canSendEnvelope": true
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        A successful response is a `newUsers` array with information about the newly created users. If there was a problem in creating a user, that user entry will contain an `errorDetails` property that describes what went wrong.

        ```json
        {
          "newUsers": [

        Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve custom user information that can be used in your own system.

        **Note**: Custom user settings are not the same as user account settings.

        ###Getting Grouped Custom User Settings###

        If the custom user settings you want to retrieve are grouped, you must include the following information in the header, after Content-Type, in the request:

        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`

        Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of customer user settings.

        If the extra header information is not included, only the custom user settings that were added without a group are retrieved.

        ***Note**: Custom user settings are not the same as user account settings.

        Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve custom user information that you can use in your own system.

        **Important**: There is a limit on the size for all the custom user settings for a single user. The limit is 4,000 characters, which includes the XML and JSON structure for the settings.

        ### Grouping Custom User Settings ###

        You can group custom user settings when adding them. Grouping allows you to retrieve settings that are in a specific group, instead of retrieving all the user custom settings.

        To group custom user settings, add the following information in the header, after Content-Type:

        `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`

        Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of customer user settings. Grouping is shown in the Example Request Body below.

        When getting or deleting grouped custom user settings, you must include the extra header information.

        Grouping custom user settings is not required and if the extra header information is not included, the custom user settings are added normally and can be retrieved or deleted without including the additional header.

        Updates the jurisdiction information about a notary.

        The following restrictions apply:

        - The current user must be a notary.
        - The `jurisdictionId` path parameter must be a jurisdiction that the notary is registered for.
        - The `jurisdictionId` path parameter must match the request body's `jurisdiction.jurisdictionId`.

        The request body must have a full `jurisdiction` object for the jurisdiction property.
        The best way to do this is to use `getNotaryJurisdiction` to obtain the current values and update the properties you want to change.

        For example, assume `getNotaryJurisdiction` returns this:

        ```
        {
            "jurisdiction": {
                "jurisdictionId": "15",
                "name": "Iowa",
                "county": "",
                "enabled": "true",
                "countyInSeal": "false",
                "commissionIdInSeal": "true",
                "stateNameInSeal": "true",
                "notaryPublicInSeal": "true",
                "allowSystemCreatedSeal": "true",
                "allowUserUploadedSeal": "false"
            },
            "commissionId": "123456",
            "commissionExpiration": "2020-08-31T07:00:00.0000000Z",
            "registeredName": "Bob Notary",
            "county": "Adams",
            "sealType": "system_created"
        }
        ```

        If you want to change the name of the notary from "Bob Notary" to "Robert Notary", your request body would be:

        ```
        {
            "jurisdiction": {
                "jurisdictionId": "15",
                "name": "Iowa",
                "county": "",
                "enabled": "true",
                "countyInSeal": "false",
                "commissionIdInSeal": "true",
                "stateNameInSeal": "true",
                "notaryPublicInSeal": "true",

        Enables or disables API request logging for troubleshooting.

        When enabled (`apiRequestLogging` is **true**), REST API requests and responses for the user are added to a log. A log can have up to 50 requests/responses and the current number of log entries can be determined by getting the settings. Logging is automatically disabled when the log limit of 50 is reached.

        You can call [Diagnostics::getRequestLog
        ](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/Diagnostics/RequestLogs/get) or [Diagnostics::listRequestLogs](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/Diagnostics/RequestLogs/list) to download the log files (individually or as a zip file). Call [Diagnostics::deleteRequestLogs
        ](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/reference/Diagnostics/RequestLogs/delete) to clear the log by deleting current entries.

        Private information, such as passwords and integrator key information, which is normally located in the call header is omitted from the request/response log.

        API request logging only captures requests from the authenticated user. Any call that does not authenticate the user and resolve a userId is not logged.

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            When set to **true**, event delivery acknowledgements are enabled for your Connect configuration.

            DocuSign Connect awaits a valid 200 response from your application acknowledging that it received a message. If you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and places it into a failure queue. It is imperative that you acknowledge successful receipt of Connect events as they occur by sending a 200 event back.

            #### When set to **true** and Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is activated

            If the HTTP status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,
            then the message delivery failed, and the configuration is marked as down.

            The message will be queued and retried once per day.
            While a Connect configuration is marked down, subsequent notifications will not be tried. Instead they will be immediately queued with the reason `Pending`.
            When a message succeeds, all queued messages for the configuration will be tried immediately, in order.

            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When set to **true** and SIM mode is not activated

            If the HTTP Status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,  then the message delivery failed, and the message is queued.

            The message will be retried after at least a day the next time a subsequent message is successfully sent to this configuration (subscription).  Subsequent notifications will be tried when they occur.
            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When set to **false**

            When `requiresAcknowledgement` is set to **false** and you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and determines that the server is unavailable. It does not retry to send the notification message, and you must handle the failure manually.

          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

          description: |
            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\

            When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            \ an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient\
            \ still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would.\
            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\
            \ are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/\

            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          type: string
          description: |
            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

          description: |
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          type: string
          description: |
            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            \ an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient\
            \ still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would.\
            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\
            \ are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/\

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

          description: |
            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

          type: string
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          type: string
          description: |
            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

        anchorCaseSensitive:
          type: string
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          type: string
          description: |
            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\

            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\

            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\

            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

          description: |
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
            enclosed in brackets,
            to refer to it.

            For example,
            you want to present the total cost
            of two items, tax included.

            The cost of each item is stored
            in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
            The tax rate is in a number tab
            labeled TaxRate.

            The formula string for this property
            would be:
            `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            \ an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient\
            \ still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would.\
            \ When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected,\
            \ through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When\
            \ routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the\
            \ URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session. \n\n\
            If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded\
            \ signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing\
            \ action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity\
            \ and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other\
            \ ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation\
            \ launched by a partner.\n\nIt is important to understand that in a typical\
            \ embedded workflow, the authentication of an embedded recipient is the\
            \ responsibility of the sending application. DocuSign expects that senders\
            \ will follow their own processes for establishing the recipient's identity.\
            \ In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application\
            \ before the embedded signing or viewing process is initiated. However,\
            \ when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`,\
            \ the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process,\
            \ bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending\
            \ application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use\
            \ one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone\
            \ Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of\
            \ the recipient.\n\nIf the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the\
            \ `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect\
            \ URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient.\
            \ Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using\
            \ merge fields. The available merge fields items are: `envelopeId`, `recipientId`,\
            \ `recipientName`, `recipientEmail`, and `customFields`. The `customFields`\
            \ property must be set for the recipient or envelope. The merge fields\
            \ are enclosed in double brackets. \n\n*Example*: \n\n`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/\

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are aligned in relation to the anchor text. Possible values are :

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).


            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `delivered`: The recipient has viewed the documents in the envelope. This recipient status does not indicate email delivery of the documents in the envelope.

            - `declined`: The recipient has declined to sign a document in the envelope.
            - `authenticationfailed`: At least one signer has failed the authentication check on the document. If this occurs, you have two options:
               - Send a reminder to the recipients, which provides the signer with another chance to access and pass the authentication.

            When set to **true**, event delivery acknowledgements are enabled for your Connect configuration.

            DocuSign Connect awaits a valid 200 response from your application acknowledging that it received a message. If you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and places it into a failure queue. It is imperative that you acknowledge successful receipt of Connect events as they occur by sending a 200 event back.

            #### When set to **true** and Send Individual Messages (SIM) mode is activated

            If the HTTP status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,
            then the message delivery failed, and the configuration is marked as down.

            The message will be queued and retried once per day.
            While a Connect configuration is marked down, subsequent notifications will not be tried. Instead they will be immediately queued with the reason `Pending`.
            When a message succeeds, all queued messages for the configuration will be tried immediately, in order.

            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When set to **true** and SIM mode is not activated

            If the HTTP Status response to a notification message is not in the range of 200-299,  then the message delivery failed, and the message is queued.

            The message will be retried after at least a day the next time a subsequent message is successfully sent to this configuration (subscription).  Subsequent notifications will be tried when they occur.
            There is a maximum of ten retries. Alternately, you can use **Republish Connect Information** to manually republish the notification.

            #### When set to **false**

            When `requiresAcknowledgement` is set to **false** and you do not acknowledge receiving an event notification message within 100 seconds, DocuSign treats the message as a failure and determines that the server is unavailable. It does not retry to send the notification message, and you must handle the failure manually.

          type: string
          description: |-
            This property controls how [anchor tabs][AnchorTabs] are placed. When **true**, the text string in a document must match the case of the `anchorString` property for an anchor tab to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the anchor string is `DocuSign`, then `DocuSign` will match but `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will not match. When set to **false**, `DocuSign`, `Docusign`, `docusign`, `DoCuSiGn`, etc. will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

            - Unless punctuation is specified in the `anchorString`, this functionality ignores punctuation and the following characters:

              $~><|^+=

              For example, the `anchorString` `water` will match on the string `Fetch a pail of water.`

            - Strings embedded in other strings are ignored during the matching process.

            - In words that have dashes, the parts separated by dashes are treated as distinct words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `forget`, then an anchor tab is placed on the `forget` in `forget-me-not`, even when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true**.

            - Letters with accent marks are treated as distinct characters from their unaccented counterparts.

            - For single-character anchor strings, if the two characters appear right next to each other in the document, a single anchor tab is placed for both of them.

              Example: If the anchor string is `i`, then only one anchor tab is placed in `skiing`.

            - Unlike punctuation, numbers are not ignored when finding anchor words.

              Example: If the anchor string is `cat`, then `-cat-` is matched but `1cat2` is not when `anchorMatchWholeWord` is set to **true** (its default value).

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

            - `left`: Aligns the left side of the tab with the beginning of the first character of the matching anchor word. This is the default value.
            - `right`: Aligns the tab’s left side with the last character of the matching anchor word.

            **Note**: You can only specify the value of this property in POST requests.

        anchorMatchWholeWord:
          type: string
          description: |
            When set to **true**, the text string in a document must match the value of the `anchorString` property in its entirety for an [anchor tab][AnchorTab] to be created. The default value is **false**.

            For example, when set to **true**, if the input is `man` then `man` will match but `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will not. When set to **false**, if the input is `man` then `man`, `manpower`, `fireman`, and `penmanship` will all match.

            This functionality uses the following rules:

  - name: Envelopes
    summary: This section shows you how to create and send envelopes.
    description: |
      The eSignature API Envelope category includes the resources and methods for sending and managing envelopes and envelope data.

      Envelopes are the key objects in the DocuSign platform. As a result, they are complex data structures with few required fields. See the [How-to guides](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/) for examples and solutions.

      To learn more about envelopes, see [Envelopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/envelopes/).
  - name: Connect
    summary: "DocuSign Connect is the DocuSign platform notification service. The service\
    \ uses webhooks to proactively notify your application when an event occurs that\
    \ your application wants to know about. DocuSign recommends that all applications\
    \ use Connect instead of polling the DocuSign Signature Service. This section\
    \ provides information about Connect configuration and logging. \n\nFor more information\
    \ about Connect, see [DocuSign Connect](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/connect)\
    \ and [Custom Connect Configuration](https://support.docusign.com/guides/ndse-admin-guide-custom-connect-configuration-htm)."
    description: "The Connect service enables your application to be called via HTTPS\
    \ when an event of interest occurs.\n\nUse the Connect service to \"end the polling\
    \ madness.\" With Connect, there is no need for your application to poll DocuSign\
    \ every 15 minutes to learn the latest about your envelopes.\n\nInstead, you register\
    \ your interest in one or more types of envelope or recipient events. Then, when\
    \ an interesting event occurs, the DocuSign platform will contact your application\
    \ with the event's details and data. You can register interest in envelopes sent\
    \ by particular users in your account, or for envelopes sent by any user.\n\n\
    Connect can empower your organization to manage document actions as they occur,\
    \ and allows you to track their changes within your own systems. Upon completion,\
    \ envelope information, including document content, can be stored in your own\
    \ databases or CMS systems, and these events can be triggered via webhooks delivering\
    \ messages to your application.\n\n## Incoming Connect Calls\n\nTo use the Connect\
    \ service, your application needs to provide an HTTPS URL that can be called from\
    \ the public Internet. If your application runs on a server behind your organization's\
    \ firewall, then you will need to create a \"pinhole\" in the firewall to allow\
    \ the incoming Connect calls from DocuSign to reach your application. You can\
    \ also use other techniques such as proxy servers and DMZ networking for receiving\
    \ the incoming calls.\n\nConnect delivers events over HTTP requests in the form\
    \ of XML. DocuSign sends an XML object to the secure URL entered on the configuration\
    \ page for every event and user selected. \n\nIf your application is not configured\
    \ to accept post messages, DocuSign will NOT return an additional post error response\
    \ to your listener application. If you've enabled logging on your configuration,\
    \ it will be logged in Admin under the configuration failure log.\n\n## Per-envelope\
    \ Connect Configuration\nInstead of registering a general Connect configuration\
    \ and listener, an individual envelope can have its own Connect configuration.\
    \ See the `eventNotification` field for envelopes.\n\n## Categories\nUse the Connect\
    \ category for:\n\n* Programmatically creating Connect configurations. Connect\
    \ configurations can be created manually by using the DocuSign web service, or\
    \ programmatically via the API. Configurations created via the API can be seen\
    \ and updated from the web service.\n* Retrieving and managing the event log for\
    \ your Connect configurations. \n* Requesting that an event be re-published to\
    \ the listener."

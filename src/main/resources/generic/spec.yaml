      description: If the storage account's soft delete feature is disabled then, when a
        blob is deleted, it is permanently removed from the storage account. If
        the storage account's soft delete feature is enabled, then, when a blob
        is deleted, it is marked for deletion and becomes inaccessible
        immediately. However, the blob service retains the blob or snapshot for
        the number of days specified by the DeleteRetentionPolicy section of
        [Storage service properties] (Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md). After the
        specified number of days has passed, the blob's data is permanently
        removed from the storage account. Note that you continue to be charged
        for the soft-deleted blob's storage until it is permanently removed. Use
        the List Blobs API and specify the "include=deleted" query parameter to
        discover which blobs and snapshots have been soft deleted. You can then
        use the Undelete Blob API to restore a soft-deleted blob. All other
        operations on a soft-deleted blob or snapshot causes the service to
        return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound).

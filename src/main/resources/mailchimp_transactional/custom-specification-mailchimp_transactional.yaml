      summary: Start ip warmup
      description: Begins the warmup process for a dedicated IP. During the warmup
        process, the Transactional API will gradually increase the percentage of your
        mail that is sent over the warming-up IP, over a period of roughly 30 days.
        The rest of your mail will be sent over shared IPs or other dedicated IPs
        in the same pool.

      summary: Verify domain
      description: Sends a verification email in order to verify ownership of a domain.
        Domain verification is a required step to confirm ownership of a domain. Once
        a domain has been verified in a Transactional API account, other accounts
        may not have their messages signed by that domain unless they also verify
        the domain. This prevents other Transactional API accounts from sending mail
        signed by your domain.
